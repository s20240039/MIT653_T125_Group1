    #1 - A Review on SMART GRID Power System Network
    
    Theme: The paper explores the evolution of electrical grid systems to a "Smart Grid" system.

    Key Findings: The study revealed the benefits of a Smart Grid compared to the traditional distributed electric grid. It can be beneficial in high-level automation that offers great efficiency and better utilization of resources.

    Methodology: The researchers put the Traditional Grid and Smart Grid side by side, compared them through different characteristics like for example Tracking and Monitoring which was done manually using Traditional Grid and advancing to digitalizing the control and having a self-monitoring capabilities in Smart Grid. 

    Research Gap: Although, the paper reviewed the comparison of the old generation of electrical grid systems to the future of smart grid systems. The vulnerabilities and security was not clearly defined in this research.

    #2 - The Role of Machine Learning Algorithms in Smart Grid Cybersecurity.
    
    Theme: The paper discusses on how machine learning (ML) algorithms enhances smart grid cybersecurity, 
    especially in the context of the growing number of cyberattacks that target these systems.
    
    Key Findings: The study found that the Random Forest and Extreme Tree models are highly effective in 
    detecting cyber threats.The research emphasizes that machine learning models are crucial for addressing
    complex cyber threats in the energy sector and these models are more effective than the traditional 
    security measure.
    
    Methodology: The paper evaluated the performance of various machine learning algorithms, including Bagging 
    tree, Random Forest, Adaboost, and Extreme Tree. The evaluation was based on metrics such as accuracy, 
    precision,recall, and F1 score. The study also involved analyzing network traffic, user behavior, and 
    system logs to detect abnormalities that could indicate cyber threats.
    
    Research Gap: This research indicates that further investigation is needed to inprove the effectiveness of 
    cybersecurity solution in energy sector.

    #3 - Prediction of False Data Injection Attacks in Smart Grid using AdaBoost, Deep Learning, and KNN
    
    Theme: This paper examines the ways advanced machine learning algorithms can be used to boost cybersecurity
    in smart grid systems, particularly in predicting false data injection attacks (FDIAs), which are becoming
    more prevalent and disruptive cyber attacks.
    
    Key Findings: The study revealed that the K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) algorithm outperforms other models in 
    predicting FDIAs, achieving the highest accuracy (89%) and F1-score (0.76).Deep Learning also showed strong 
    performance, especially in precision (0.73), though it requires more computational resources. In comparison,
    traditional methods like logistic regression performed poorly, with low recall and precision, emphasizing the
    limitations of older techniques in dealing with modern cyber threats.
    
    Methodology: The authors compared the performance of three machine learning algorithms—AdaBoost, Deep 
    Learning, and KNN—on an openly available smart grid dataset. The comparison was made  using four most 
    informative performance metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The dataset included normal and 
    attack signs so that models can learn and distinguish between legitimate and malicious behavior efficiently.
    
    Research Gap: While the performance is better in the case of Deep Learning and KNN, research indicates
    emphasizing the importance of analyzing other models such as SVC, LDA, and Naïve Bayes for further boosting 
    detection rates. Repeating similar procedures on other datasets and even in other main infrastructure systems
    is another activity to be carried out in the future.
